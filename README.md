# cloud-optional-starter

I created this repo to better understand Dexie cloud sharing and set up some examples to help with reproducibility. Maybe it'll be helpful to others.

### Hard-coded demo users on your own Dexie Cloud DB
I added some hard-coded demo users so you can try logging in as them. Per [https://dexie.org/cloud/docs/add-demo-users](this link) run this command: `npx dexie-cloud import demo-users.json`
